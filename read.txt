I have Tourette's Syndrome. It's an illness that causes me a lot of stress and tension in my life.
This involves involuntary noises, which I have managed to disguise in the past to some degree with coughing, twitching, shrugging, "huffing", blinking, tapping and sometimes makes me bite things. It makes me fiddly, fidgety and restless. It causes me back pain, tiredness as my body is always on the move, a dry throat which causes me to cough a lot, tension and other physical aches and pains.
My tics are often accelerated by excitement and anxiety. Tourette's is like an itch. You can't control it. You try your best not to 'tic' but the more you suppress it, the more it'll 'come out'. I have also suffered from depression, which stemmed from bullying when I was younger and from my father's death when I was 14 and, at times, severe anxiety.
While it seems like fate has handed me a bad hand as far as mental illness goes, it has also handed me an ace. I met my fiancee Kerrie at college in Hull three years ago. I had been studying my final year of my degree in musical theatre and she was doing her first Diploma in performing arts. It hadn't been the best year of my life. It was my first time living away from home and I'd began suffering from anxiety and had several short bouts of depression which had affected my college work at times. When Kerrie and I met, as cheesy as this sounds, it was a magical unleashing. I was able to do things that I'd never been able to do. I'd always thought of myself as "unlovable" but there was this girl and she's head over heels for me and it blew my mind, and still does to this day.
We had to live apart for quite some time as she was still doing her education in Hull and we'd only see each other every two weeks or for half term and holidays. About four months into our relationship, I proposed. She said yes. I never ever thought I'd ever be a position to say I was getting married but now I was. And on October 4th last year, we finally got married. You see, Kerrie also suffers from mental illness - OCD and PTSD. She knows how difficult it can be at times. She has been with me through my two CBTs already and my sessions with a psychiatrist, through my diagnosis after many years of suffering with "an unknown disorder" of Tourette's, she's been with me through my grief counselling with CRUSE and soon through what I confident will be my final sessions of CBT.
Love is a powerful force. It guides you through the storms in our heads and bodies that is commonly known as mental illness and it will see you safely to shore. I know there are many people out there who aren't so lucky to find "the one" who will never judge you and especially when going through trying times, it's love that's needed - not just by others but to ourselves. Slowly and surely, thanks to love, I am accepting myself. I think of myself as an extremely lucky one to be in love and to be loved. So hold out hope. If it can happen to me, there is hope for everyone out there.




As a 22-year-old, I look back at my school life, particularly high school. I wouldn’t say I was jumping from the rooftops screaming I was having a blast, but I didn’t hate every moment either. It was school. I went, I did work, I went home and would count down the days till the weekend.

But I remember always being told "enjoy school, it’s the best years of your life!” This put a lot of anxiety and pressure on me.

Best years of your life? For who? What if these aren’t the best years of my life? What’s yet to come? Is this as good as it gets? What do adults deal with?

Looking at children now, I feel like the saying that school is the “best years of your life,” is getting less and less the case.

Children deal with a lot of stress and I can vouch for that – and it’s never easy hearing an adult saying “you don’t know what stress is”.

Being made to think of what kind of job you want, before you can spell your own name, has a massive impact. This meant at such an early age I was already having to think, "What is a good job? What can I realistically do with the qualifications I may or may not get? How much can I survive on?"

Children may also have to deal with a lot of extra factors, such as home life and bullying, things out of their control. Bullying has got worse over the years. The existence of social media has made it even worse so that bullying can happen 24/7.

At a young age I was witnessing videos of people fist fighting, calling each other racial, homophobic and transphobic slurs. Statuses belittling people. I’ve seen it all.

It makes me sick to my stomach but instead of giving it an angry emoji reaction and a share, we can make a difference and teach children about how vital it is to take care of your mental wellbeing before something unimaginable happens.



My daughter Oona was delivered by C-section at 31 weeks - weighing just 860 grams (less than 2lbs). I saw a glimpse of my tiny child and she was whisked off to intensive care.

When I first held her, I felt overwhelmingly in love...then the euphoria switched off and I wanted her off me. I told a doctor, but she said I just needed to sleep. Instead, I stayed up all night frantically writing about Oona: I stalked the corridors and even shouted "I’m psychotic" to a midwife.

The next day, my best friend Amy visited and I decided to discharge myself. We went home and while Amy was out buying me a breast pump, something in my mind just switched. I can remember shouting, "This is where my story ends."

I was extremely lucky to survive. It was Amy who persuaded me to get into the ambulance. It was her straight-talking, caring attitude, I think, that saved my life.

Back in hospital, it took me a week and a half to recover from my back injuries and, to the outside world, I was also recovering from my mental health crisis - which now had a name: 'postpartum psychosis'. But a week after going home, I had another episode and was placed in the Maudsley Hospital.

That week at the Maudsley, I was out of my mind. But eventually I realised that I was in the right place: that the nurses were there to help me and that I, like the other patients, had a mental health problem.

Then after a week and a half, the Mother and Baby Unit at Bethlem had a room free. I was one of the lucky ones - had I been in Northern Ireland, where my mum lives, there would be no provision for me.

Once on the Unit, I was doing well, but the day after my longed-for baby joined me on the ward, the depression that so often follows postpartum psychosis kicked in and all the love I had previously felt for Oona disappeared overnight.

After two dreadful weeks, the medication started to work. My depression and anxiety subsided. I gradually returned home and started to get used to life as a new mum but while my husband Henry was a loving dad, I felt isolated and directionless a lot of the time.

Talking to other local women who were also struggling proved to be a lifeline. It was wonderfully freeing to be able to meet up and talk openly about what happened to us, to laugh together and bask in their wellness. Oona and I now have a wonderful relationship.




We've come such a long way in improving mental health. But unless we can tip the scales, people like Benj will still be left on the brink.

Since our charity was founded nearly 70 years ago, pioneering researchers and forward-thinking supporters like you have helped to change the landscape of mental health for the better.

However, despite considerable progress, compared to physical health, so little is commonly known about mental ill health. That must change.

This isn't just about treating mental ill health, but preventing it too

I first experienced depression when I moved to University
"I didn't realise it at the time," he says, "I thought it was a natural part of the experience - trying to establish social networks and getting to grips with my studies. But looking back it's clear I became very isolated."

Benj started to spend long periods alone in his room, anxious and fearful of meeting new people. He struggled to sleep and make decisions, even to remember that he'd put a pizza in the oven. Away from home and his usual support networks, there was no one he trusted to confide in and, looking back, it's now clear that he became very unwell.

Accessing support for my mental health
Benj struggled on for three years at University with the support of his girlfriend, but when that relationship ended, he hit rock bottom and was forced to take a year out:

"That Christmas, I was too unhappy to get out of bed and couldn't even feign interest in opening my presents. I was clinically diagnosed, but despite receiving medication, I was suicidal and realised I couldn't carry on."

Eventually, thanks to the support of his mum, Benj managed to get counselling through his University: "I received 10 sessions, which I often say was one of the best things I have ever done."

Today, Benj still sometimes relapses, but he is able to manage. "I think it's a positive step that more attention is being given to the fact that the university experience puts young people in stressful situations," he says, adding: "It's important that the support is there for young people leaving home for the first time and entering a completely new and demanding environment."

Mental health is an issue that affects us all and it's going to take all of us to tackle it
While Benj's experience is unique to him, he is not alone as depression remains one of the most common mental health problems in the UK.

One in five people in the UK aged 16 and over are experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression right now.

On average, around 16 people end their own lives every day due to mental ill health - that's around one person every two hours. And if we don't act urgently, depression will soon be the most common health condition experienced globally.

Mental health problems are just as important as physical health problems; just as devastating and just as life-threatening - just not so well-funded. That's why we need your help today just as much if not more than we ever have.




Before I tell you this story, I want to ask you to imagine this situation. Imagine spending days and weeks without speaking to another person. Imagine turning the television and the radio on, just so you can hear someone else’s voice. Imagine staring out of the window, looking at your neighbours getting on with their lives, reminiscing of a time when your life was full of everyday activities. You long to go out, meet friends and have a conversation. Imagine feeling deeply alone and isolated.

For nearly one million people over 65 in the UK, this scene is not in their imagination. It is their life.
In my experience, the effects of loneliness are often overlooked or dismissed especially when we talk about older people. I have met many vulnerable older people and seen the devastating impact that loneliness has had, especially on their mental health.

The statistics are distressing. One in five older people are living with depression. But one person’s story helped me understand this reality more than any other. I want to tell you Gillian’s story although I have changed Gillian’s details at her request.

Gillian’s life dramatically changed when she had to go to the hospital for a hip operation. Aged 70, the effect on Gillian was not just physical, her mental health also deteriorated and she subsequently withdrew into herself. She spent three long months in hospital.

Unbelievably, whilst in hospital Gillian’s local authority cleared out her flat of all her personal belongings and memories she had spent years collecting. On leaving hospital, Gillian had no access to the things she loved and treasured. The life she knew was no more. She was devastated. She felt like she had experienced a bereavement.

We will all have time in our lives when we feel alone. Sometimes loneliness is not a choice but a reality forced on us. Life changing events such as retirement, the death of a loved one, the loss of independence as a result of poor health, can affect our mental well-being. As we get older, we are more vulnerable to these life events leading us to withdraw from social situations further and become very isolated.

On leaving hospital Gillian was relocated to extra care accommodation, miles away from her friends and familiar surroundings. She became depressed and started to experience anxiety attacks. She withdrew from life and doing the things she loved.

Gillian did not leave her flat for a whole year. She did not go out and meet her friends or make any efforts to interact with the other residents. Gillian only saw a care worker for 20 minutes per day who was too busy doing their job. She had only the radio or the television for company.



I cared for my mum who was diagnosed with early onset dementia at the age of 51 until she passed at the age of 54 in 2013. Caring for my mum was my life for my late twenties, but I did this alongside a full time job and a few volunteer projects I was involved in.

To be able to spend so much time with my mum before she passed was a blessing. Yes, it was staggeringly difficult and upsetting doesn’t even come close to describing it at times, but knowing that I did all I could to make life the best for her that I possibly could is so comforting.

My mum and I’s relationship changed when she developed dementia. My mum had gone from caring for me as a child, to being a great friend in my early adult years, to now a complete role reversal where I became her carer. Caring for someone whose role it was to care for you is hard but it gave me a way to give back to her for everything she had ever done for me as a child. She always put me first and now it was my turn to put her first.

With dementia my mum lost her ability to hold a conversation so it was hard at times to really know how she was feeling inside but the amazing thing was that the one sentence she always remembered and one she said often was "I love you". That was all I could ever need. The relationship may have changed but the bedrock of that relationship remained and never changed, that love for each other.

I was heartbroken when we got the diagnosis and felt so useless knowing that nothing I could do could stop the onslaught of dementia but it didn’t stop me trying to do everything I could in the vain attempt to try and do something to stop it. Doing this was the only thing that kept me going: it was like I fooled myself in to believing things would get better in order to keep positive and to keep trying my hardest. Years since my mum’s passing I still miss her and wish I could turn back the clock but it is great comfort to know that I was with her until the end and to know I did everything I possibly could to help. 

Before my mum passed I made her a promise that I would honour her legacy by writing a book about our experiences and her impact on this world, which I achieved last year with the release of Unbreakable Bond.

I want to create a legacy for my mum, she was about helping others before thinking about herself and the more I can help others, the more I can honour her. On behalf of my mum and me, I would just like to thank the countless carers out there who are all doing amazing work for people who matter and who do really need us.




Jenny’s father was admitted to a psychiatric ward on New Year’s Eve 2009. It was not how her family thought they’d welcome the New Year and it changed their lives forever.

My father was a hard-working family man. The trigger for his mental health problems was being diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease and being made redundant, from a company he had given over 40 years of service.

During this time my father became unwell with depression and anxiety. Until then, I was unaware of mental health problems. It was something I thought would never happen to me.

But I’ve come to realise that it’s a question of when, not if, a mental health problem will affect you or a loved one.

We are dedicated to creating a world with better mental health for everyone at every age. Jenny's father is not alone. Poor mental health is often overlooked and exacerbated by the isolation and physical health problems associated with ageing.

This is why we are working to support people like Jenny's father through our pioneering peer-support projects like our Standing Together project.





I have recently been diagnosed by my GP as having early stage Alzheimer's.

I was having difficulty saying words and remembering things that had recently happened. Being told this may sound devastating to you, but for me, understanding what was happening gave me peace of mind. I'm now taking medication and going to the self-help group. I've made friends at the group with others who understand my difficulties. One of my new friends taught me how to play cards and I'm enjoying life more since I've started going to the group.

I live in extra care sheltered accommodation and the other members of the Dementia Self-help Group are tenants there too. We meet weekly, because we all worry about our memory. We support each other, discuss, share and learn. Despite this tricky subject we decided to call ourselves the 'Happy Days Memory Group'. Life isn't always easy but having a happy positive attitude helps.

There are twelve of us with an average age of 86. The oldest in the group is 96 and I'm actually the youngest! Three people help us run the group: Barbara, a fellow tenant; Tom, a psychology graduate wishing to gain experience; and Cindy from the Mental Health Foundation who set up the group.

Each meeting there is a different activity or theme. For example we talked about our names, and discovered everyone has a relative called John! And we discussed how it's hard to remember names and ideas to help us. I've learnt a lot about my mind, memory and also how to do Sudoku, which keeps my mind active. And we've had some really interesting guests to visit us.

As the meetings progressed we decided to write about them on a blog. Do read our blog and please share our experience and ideas with others who may find it useful.

We've all learnt a lot from Cindy, visiting guests and from each other. Together we came up with lots of ideas about how we can take more control of our own lives and enjoy our later years. One of them is to produce a welcome guide for new people coming to live here to make it easier for them to feel at home. I look forward to meeting up each week, making plans, sharing stories and concerns, as well as enjoying the company of the group.




I love city life. The constant buzz of activity, the diversity of people and experiences, and the fact you’re never short of something to do. I find it exhilarating.   

But I also find living and working in a big city can be draining sometimes, too. A stressful day at work can be compounded by a stressful commute – crammed on an overcrowded train, people rushing past – it doesn’t always allow you the time to relax or recharge. There have been times in my life where I’ve felt hugely overwhelmed and stressed, and haven’t been sure how to escape the bustle.  

That’s where I’ve found nature – even in small amounts – has helped. For me it’s an escape from my thoughts and my stresses; it’s almost meditative.   

If I’ve had a rough day, on my commute I try to count the trees that I pass. I try to notice the changes each day or each week – leaves falling, the sounds of different birds, seasons changing as I look out the train window. In the winter I look at stars or the changing moon and realise just how small we all are. The more I notice, the more I slowly forget about work or the people around me and feel part of something bigger.

I find it incredibly reassuring to know that no matter what’s happened in my day, nature’s still there, just doing its thing, beyond our control. Even in the city we’re surrounded by it. It puts things into much better perspective and helps me feel connected to the wider world – to forget my own trivial worries.  

I love city life but for me nature is a crucial part of thriving amid the bustle.


We all have mental health as well as physical health and it is long overdue that mental health is afforded the same parity as physical health across society.

I'm happy to see that public attitudes to mental health seem to be improving, but there is still much to be done. The World Health Organization defines mental health as a state of wellbeing in which every individual realises his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community.

This is a state of wellbeing that we all aspire to, but shouldn't it really just be our basic human right?

The most effective way of ensuring good mental health for all is to prevent poor mental health developing in the first place and improve early intervention when it does occur. It is intuitive therefore that we start in schools, teaching our children and young people about mental health and wellbeing, and developing their emotional resilience by teaching them positive coping skills and providing them with a toolbox of strategies to use when they are faced with circumstances that affect their wellbeing.

Bullying, maltreatment, poverty, relationships and belonging are just a few factors that children and young people may face, which are known to adversely affect mental health.

50% of adults with mental health problems develop them by the time they are 14 years old, and 75% between the ages of 18 and 24, depending on the research study you look at. This was the case for my son Conor.

Conor took his own life earlier this year. Like myself, he was bullied throughout his school life and I have no doubt would have benefited from being educated about mental health and how to effectively cope with that stress.

His story could have been so very different if he'd had that support at that key stage of his life. Had his mental health problems been prevented or had he been given targeted early intervention support, it's highly unlikely that he would have taken his own life.
